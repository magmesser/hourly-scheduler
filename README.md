# Work Day Scheduler Project

## User Story 
```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Description

This project tested my knowledge of JavaScript, jQuery and third-party APIs such as Bootstrap, Moment.js and FontAwesome and Google Fonts.  I ensured that the code was debugged to the best of my ability and ran correctly.  This assignment was challenging but the implementation of third party APIs has improved the efficiency of my code and helped to better understand JS concepts. When I got stuck I used Google to research local storage and read through StackOverflow, and watched YouTube videos, as well as researching specific elements in W3Schools and MDN.
